# Shani-Narkiss-et-al.-2020.


Here are all the codes and data from Shani-Narkiss et al., 2020.
Everything is provided, such that all figures and statistical tests appearing in the paper could be reproduced (and much more). One should just download the data files and insert their path correctly with the code. 
For physiology data- in addition to that, in order to make the process easier- there are already saved variables in the path General_Physiology\MATLAB Supp.  
These variables could be used when one wants to see figures\bottom-line results, skipping the first codes needed to generate them.However, due to git-hubâ€™s limitation for files bigger than 25 mb, some files have been compressed and added here as .rar files. If you get an error message regarding a missing variable while running the code (AND you did not run all codes sequentially, but went straight to the later codes with variables from MATLAB Supp folder), check if your missing variable is zipped and needs to be extracted first

The logic of this dataset is such that codes are ran sequentially, to generate in the first codes variables that are used in later codes. Follow the instructions and change manually the commented\uncommented text in the beginning of each code to focus on the group of interest.
