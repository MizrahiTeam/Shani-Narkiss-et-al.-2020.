In order to plot these figures, chose one of the following options:

1- Run the codes sequentially, according to the following order, in order to save in earlier stage variables that will be used in later scripts:
*permutations_over_data_from_0 (Make sure to have the function “permutationTest”, that is in the “General Physiology” folder, is located in you MATLAB path)
*code1_PHYSIOLOGY 
*code2_PHYSIOLOGY
*code_4_for_time_lapse_Fig5 (however note that some things in this code need to be ran twice, since it is sometimes built for coupled compariosons and not tripled)

 Note that if this approach is chosen, the only thing that is needed preliminarily are the raw data, all are located in: “General_Physiology\all_physiology_data” and referred at the code such that only the path needs to be well-defined. 

2- Alternatively, run code2_PHYSIOLOGY and then code4_PHYSIOLOGY directly, and use preliminarily acquired variables- all are located in the “General_Physiology\MATLAB Supp” folder


Note that important details regarding the different groups are located in commented text within the codes, as well as in the file “Important_Detailes_physiology” that is located in the “General Physiology’’ folder.
